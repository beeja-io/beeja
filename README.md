##  Beeja Backend - Run Options (Docker & Manual)

You can run the Beeja backend services in two different ways:

---

###  Option 1: Run with Docker 


####  Steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/beeja-io/beeja.git
   ```

2. **Build and Run the Services**
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```

3. **Verify Running Services**
   -  Eureka Service Registry: [http://localhost:8761]
   -  Swagger API Documentation for each service:
     ```
     http://localhost:<microservice-port>/swagger-ui
     ```

 Tip: Make sure Docker is installed and running on your system before executing these commands.

---

###  Option 2: Run Manually (Without Docker)

Use this method if you prefer running services directly on your machine.

#### Prerequisites:
- Java 17  
- Gradle (or use the included Gradle wrapper)
- Set any required environment variables or configuration files as needed

####  Steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/beeja-io/beeja.git
   ```

2. **Build All Backend Services**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Files**
   - Before running the services, ensure all necessary environment variables are properly set.
   - You can configure them in `.env` files or directly in the `application.yml`of each microservice as   required.

4. **Run Microservices Individually**  
   Navigate into each microservice folder:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew bootRun
   ```

5. **Verify Services**
   - Access each service on its configured port (check `application.yml` or `.env` files).
   - Swagger UI will be available at:
     ```
     http://localhost:<microservice-port>/swagger-ui
     ```
